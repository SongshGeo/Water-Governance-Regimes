## Project structure

I organized this projects as following structure:

- Folder `notebooks` archives the Jupyter notebooks files to plot figures.
- Folder `script` archives the python scripts.
- `tex` is manuscript, where main and sup are main text and supplementary materials.
- `tools` are self-defined functions used in the whole project.
- `figures`, `data` used for saving figures and data.
- `drafts` are some testing scripts.
