# Response to Qin

**Comment 1**: *Consider shortening the current Introduction and make it more relevant to your 3 core dimensions. That should be your focus. Why are these 3 dimensions? How do you define, why are they important, maybe some examples… that’s the foundation of your study.*

**Response:** Thanks a lot about the guideful comment on introduction. I have deleted some too general introduction sentences now. Instead, I added a specific example to depict three aspects:

> *[P2, L056-062]* For example, under a human-dominated regime, reservoirs make water stress easier to be alleviated becasue of flexibility; growing energy and industrial demands make water services purposes lopsided to non-provisioning sectors; conveyance system make water allocation more planned (Figure 1A)

Furthermore, as I mentioned just above, I used the term "aspect" rather than "dimensions" now, becasue we try to let reader know that "stress, purpose, and allocation" are not our main focus. Yes, as you noticed, they are foundation, but we want to show that we just accept and choose the three aspects according to one of general definitions of "goals of water governance" (deciding who gets water, when and how), and then summarize the UNDP's definition into three terms. To do so, I refactor the introduction section, and now in the second paragraph, I get straight to the point:

> *[P2, L070-081]* Water governance refers to the political, social, economic, and administrative systems that influence the use and management of water, essentially about "who gets water, when and how". Therefore, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has suggested that three core aspects of water use decided by water governance correspondingly: "When and what water to use?" (stress), "How does water provide different services for human well-being?" (purpose), and "Who can use water equally and efficiently?" (allocation).

I think it can inform reader that these are not our originity but just a reasonable summary. I hope the structure now will reduce your confusing and convince our potential readers.

**Comment 2:** *Why are these three the very ‘core’ dimensions? I’m not familiar with these ‘Stress/Provision/Allocation’ dimensions. Is this something commonly used, or is this sth that you proposed? As your whole work is based on this framework, I feel you should carefully explain why these three dimensions are chosen at the introduction section*

**Response:** Thanks a lot about the comment on my figure 1. Yes, it depicts my framework, so it's important to make it easy for readers to follow so I spent a lot of time to re-design it based on your comment. Now I want to show the three water governance aspects (as I explained in the main text, they are summarised from previous studies) by illustration, and explain why they changed along the hydrosocial transition. Then, explain how we measure the regime shifts:

![framework](https://songshgeo-picgo-1302043007.cos.ap-beijing.myqcloud.com/uPic/framework.png)

**Caption:** Framework for identifying the water governance regimes in transitions of a hydrosocial cycle. Water stress (S), purpose of water services (P) and water allocation (A) are three aspects to be considered (**A.** Three aspects). Along hydrosocial-cycle transitions, a human-dominated regime influences these aspects of water governance, such as: construction of reservoirs (1) aims to alleviate water stress; growth of energy and industry (2), water-lead intensive agriculture (3); conveyance system (4) controls water allocation. Therefore, the methonology is to combine three aspects' corresponding indicator, and then an abrupt change of the IWGI can indicate a regime shift in water governance (**B.**).

**Comment 3:** *I feel you should use more detailed descriptions and maybe a few examples make it clear early on the implications of each of your core dimension. Also, should define the three regimes: are they defined by you or previous studies? And what are the core characteristics of each regime, and differences across regimes?*

**Response:** Thanks for pointing it out. I suppose the three regimes' name are not "results", but brief digestion after our "discussion". Therefore, I delete the sentence here and move it to the discussion section:

> [P5, L246-L252] In the case of the YRB, our results show that there have been three distinct governance regimes, we named them as: a massive supply regime (P1: 1965-1978), a governance transforming regime (P2: 1979-2001) and an adaptation oriented regime (P3: 2002-2013).

We name them here, and then discuss their characteristic as interpretation.

**Comment 4:** *agriculture as provisioning water. Others are non-provisioning water uses, such as energy water use: Need to justify.*

Thanks for the comment. I make it more claer now:

> [P8 L374-L380] In this study, we consider livestock water use, rural and urban domestic water use, and agricultural water use as provisioning water, because they directly service for survival. Others are non-provisioning water uses: services water use and industrial water use, because they mainly service for economy.

**Comment 5:** *"Applying the index to a rapidly-changing large river basin (the Yellow River Basin, China) describes": Check the grammer.*

Thanks for the comment. I fixed the problem:

> [P7 L336-L340] Applying the IWGI to a rapidly-changing large river basin (the Yellow River Basin, China), we interpret how water governance shifts between three regimes over half a century.

Then, I polished my text throughout again.
