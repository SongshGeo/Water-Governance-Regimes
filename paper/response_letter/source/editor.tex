\subsection{General comments}
\RC{} Dear Authors, thanks for the submission of the manuscript. We have asked two experts in the relevant fields to review the manuscript. Both reviewers overall find the merit in the manuscript however they also noted several major issues in the current manuscript. With my own reading, I fully agree with the reviewers and would like to highlight a few major issues:

\AR{} Thank you for your constructive comments and for providing us with the opportunity to address the concerns raised by both reviewers. We appreciate the valuable feedback, which has helped us identify areas for improvement in our manuscript. We have carefully considered each point and have made substantial revisions to address these issues. Please find our detailed responses to the highlighted concerns below.

\subsection{Issue \#1}
\RC{} overall the results and discussion are relatively shallow and I would encourage the authors to do deep dive into the results, e.g.\ change points, as also pointed out by both reviewers,

\AR{} We acknowledge the need for a more in-depth analysis of our previous results. We have re-evaluated our data and expanded the results and discussion sections to include a deeper dive into the findings, specifically regarding the change points mentioned by both reviewers. We have also provided more context, explanation, and robustness analysis in the Supporting Informations (Section S2 to Section S4).

\subsection{Issue \#2}
\RC{} I fully agree with Reviewer \#2 that more thorough review of existing and relevant indicators with IWGI,

\AR{} We agree with Reviewer \#2's suggestion to include a more thorough review of existing and relevant indicators with IWGI.\ We have added a new paragraph in the introduction discussing the existed indexes, comparing and contrasting their strengths and weaknesses, and explaining innovation of IWGI.\

\subsection{Issue \#3}
\RC{} I would encourage the authors to look into more recent data (beyond 2013) as pointed out by Reviewer 1. In addition, I find the data in Supporting Informations is not accessible, which should be amended. The data access and reproduction of the methodology/results are very important for WRR and our scientific community, so we take the issue related with data accessibility very seriously.

\RC*{} Overall, based on the reviewers' recommendations, I would like to ask the authors to submit a suitably revised manuscript in due course.

\AR{} We appreciate the importance of using up-to-date data in our research. We have now included more recent data in our analysis.

\AR*{} We apologize for the inconvenience caused by the inaccessibility of the dataset. We have rectified this issue by refined our data description. Now, all the used datasets and their links are detailed described in the method section.

\AR*{} We hope that these revisions address the concerns raised by both reviewers and the associate editor. We are confident that these changes have significantly improved the quality of our manuscript and made it more relevant and valuable to the scientific community. We look forward to your further feedback and the possibility of our manuscript being accepted for publication.
