%  SUPPORTING INFORMATION TEMPLATE
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%
%
%
%Please use this template when formatting and submitting your Supporting Information.

%This template serves as both a “table of contents” for the supporting information for your article and as a summary of files.
%
%
%OVERVIEW
%
%Please note that all supporting information will be peer reviewed with your manuscript. It will not be copyedited if the paper is accepted.
%In general, the purpose of the supporting information is to enable authors to provide and archive auxiliary information such as data tables, method information, figures, video, or computer software, in digital formats so that other scientists can use it.
%The key criteria are that the data:
% 1. supplement the main scientific conclusions of the paper but are not essential to the conclusions (with the exception of
%    including %data so the experiment can be reproducible);
% 2. are likely to be usable or used by other scientists working in the field;
% 3. are described with sufficient precision that other scientists can understand them, and
% 4. are not exe files.
%
%USING THIS TEMPLATE
%
%***All references should be included in the reference list of the main paper so that they can be indexed, linked, and counted as citations.  The reference section does not count toward length limits.
%
%All Supporting text and figures should be included in this document. Insert supporting information content into each appropriate section of the template. To add additional captions, simply copy and paste each sample as needed.

%Tables may be included, but can also be uploaded separately, especially if they are larger than 1 page, or if necessary for retaining table formatting. Data sets, large tables, movie files, and audio files should be uploaded separately. Include their captions in this document and list the file name with the caption. You will be prompted to upload these files on the Upload Files tab during the submission process, using file type “Supporting Information (SI)”

%IMPORTANT NOTE ON FIGURES AND TABLES
% Placeholders for figures and tables appear after the \end{article} command, after references.
% DO NOT USE \psfrag or \subfigure commands.
%
 \usepackage{graphicx}
%
%  Uncomment the following command to allow illustrations to print
%   when using Draft:
\setkeys{Gin}{draft=true}
%
% You may need to use one of these options for graphicx depending on the driver program you are using.
%
% [xdvi], [dvipdf], [dvipsone], [dviwindo], [emtex], [dviwin],
% [pctexps],  [pctexwin],  [pctexhp],  [pctex32], [truetex], [tcidvi],

\noindent\textbf{Introduction}
%Type or paste your text here. The introduction gives a brief overview of the supporting information. You should include information %about as many of the following as possible (when appropriate):
% 1. a general overview of the kind of data files;
% 2. information about when and how the data were collected or created;
% 3. a general description of processing steps used;
% 4. any known imperfections or anomalies in the data.
When calculating the indicators (especially the SFV water stress index and the allocation entropy metric), we should use data at a lower (regional scale in this study) spatial scale. Therefore, we divide the YRB into four regions: source region (SR), upper region (UR), middle region (MR), and lower region (LR), according to characteristics and customary practices in the~\ref{secA1}.
The formulation in detail for applying the SFV-index is available in the~\ref{secA2}.
We used multiple sources of datasets in this study, \\textit{Supporting Information}~\ref{secA3} introduces where they came from and how we harmonies them for analysis.
