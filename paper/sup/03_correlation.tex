By analyzing the correlation of the integrated management index (IWGI) and its three sub-indexes: stress (IS), purpose (IP) and allocation (IA) in three different periods, namely, the massive supply regime (P1: $1965 \sim 1978$), governance transforming regime (P2: $1979 \sim 2001$) and adaptation oriented regime (P3: $2002 \sim 2013$), the following results are obtained.

When we focus on the correlation from P1 to P3, the results show significant negative correlation between IS and IP (correlation coefficient is $r = -0.75$, $p < 0.01$), indicating that there is a strong negative relationship between IS and IP.\
On the other hand, there is a significant positive correlation between IA and IWGI (correlation coefficients are $r = 0.75$, $p < 0.01$), indicating a positive relationship between IA and IWGI.\ However, the correlations of other combinations are not statistically significant overall.

The correlations between time periods are very different with the overall trend above.
There is no significant correlation between any indicator combinations in the massive supply regime (P1).
In the governance transforming regime (P2), there is a significant negative correlation between IS and IP (correlation coefficient $r = -0.90$, $p < 0.01$), a significant negative correlation between IS and IA (correlation coefficient $r = -0.87$, $p < 0.01$), and a significant positive correlation between IP and IA (correlation coefficient $r = 0.77$, $p < 0.01$).
The correlations between IS and IP, IS and IA, and IS and IWGI were not statistically significant in the adaptation oriented regime (P3). However, there is a significant negative correlation between IP and IA (correlation coefficients are $r = -0.86$, $p < 0.01$).
