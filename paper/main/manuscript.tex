\begin{abstract}
Water governance determine ``who gets water, when, and how'' in most large river basins.
Shifts in water governance regimes from natural to social-ecological or ``hydrosocial'' carry profound implications for human wellbeing; identifying regime changes in water governance is critical to navigating social-ecological transitions and guiding sustainability.
We characterized water governance along with the three main aspects - stress, purpose, and allocation - to develop a quantitative Integrated Water Governance Index (IWGI) at a basin scale.
Applying the IWGI to the rapidly-changing Yellow River Basin (YRB) in China clarifies shifts in water governance between massive supply, transformation governance, and adaptation-oriented regimes.
In the YRB, the underlying causes of regime shifts were increasing water supply and demand before the governance transformation and re-allocation and regulation after the change.
The IWGI offers a comprehensive and straightforward approach to linking water governance regimes to sustainability, providing valuable insights into hydrosocial transitions.

% Here are instructions on writing a Plain Language Summary:

Missing governance means missing sustainability. However, the lack of a comprehensive but straightforward approach to identifying the changes in water governance presents a challenge for efforts to underpin it. Therefore, we choose indicators for the corresponding aspects (water stress, water services purpose, and water allocation) and combine them into an integrated water governance index (IWGI) to analyze long-term changes in a large river basin.

%%% Suggested section heads:
% \section{Introduction}
%
% The main text should start with an introduction. Except for short
% manuscripts (such as comments and replies), the text should be divided
% into sections, each with its own heading.
\section{Introduction}\label{sec1}
\input{01_introduction}

% Headings should be sentence fragments and do not begin with a
% lowercase letter or number. Examples of good headings are:
\section{Materials and Methods}\label{sec11}
\input{02_methods}
% \section{Materials and Methods}
% Here is text on Materials and Methods.
%
% \subsection{A descriptive heading about methods}
% More about Methods.
%
% \section{Data} (Or section title might be a descriptive heading about data)

% EXAMPLE FIGURES
%
% \begin{figure}
% \includegraphics{example.png}
% \caption{caption}
% \end{figure}
%
% Giving latex a width will help it to scale the figure properly. A simple trick is to use \textwidth. Try this if large figures run off the side of the page.
% \begin{figure}
% \noindent\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{anothersample.png}
%\caption{caption}
%\label{pngfiguresample}
%\end{figure}
%
%
% If you get an error about an unknown bounding box, try specifying the width and height of the figure with the natwidth and natheight options. This is common when trying to add a PDF figure without pdflatex.
% \begin{figure}
% \noindent\includegraphics[natwidth=800px,natheight=600px]{samplefigure.pdf}
%\caption{caption}
