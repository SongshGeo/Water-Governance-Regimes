% 这一节主要展示IWGI的变化趋势和WUR的划分
Two significant breakpoints divide the changes in the IWGI into three periods, with different contributions from three dimensions (Figure~\ref{fig:IWGI}A).
% 第一阶段
In the first period (P1, 1965-1978), the IWGI decreased rapidly.
While the indicator of purpose and allocation contributed more to the IWGI ($49.45\%$ and $34.95\%$ on average, respectively), the remarkable downward trend correlates significantly ($p<0.01$) to the decreasing allocation and stress indicators (Figure~\ref{fig:IWGI}B).
% 第二阶段
In the second period (P2, 1979-2001), the increasing stress indicator significantly ($p<0.01$) contributed to the upward IWGI, while the allocation and purpose indicators played negative roles in changing the IWGI.
% 第三阶段
During the third period (P3, 1995-2013), while the stress indicator kept its most prominent share in contributions ($57.11\%$ on average), the increased allocation indicator and decreased purpose indicator changed the regime of IWGI.
% Overall
Taken together, the overall features of the three dimensions in different periods are relative to a directional change in the combination of three dimensions (Figure~\ref{fig:IWGI}C).
The results suggest three distinct water governance regimes: a massive supply regime (P1: 1965-1978), a governance transforming regime (P2: 1979-2001), and an adaptation oriented regime (P3: 2002-2013).

\subsection{Causes of the regime shifts}

These named reservoirs are significant for the whole basin rather than local development.
		\textbf{D.} Social transformations (red triangles) and national-level governance policies (the circles, different colours denote signed by different state institutions, see \textit{Appendix} Table~\ref{tab:policies}). The light grey bars count official documents related to the YRB on a basinal scale (the Yellow River Events).

% 进一步挖掘IWGI变化的根本原因，
The underlying causes of changes in the IWGI are associated with various factors but are different in the two regime shifts.
% 灌溉区扩张和工业和服务业的经济增长是P1和P2目的变化的关键。
Changing water demands and supply were critical to the shift between P1 and P2.
% P1年，黄河流域灌溉农业面积以图A的速度快速扩张，灌溉用水占主导(1965年占总用水的$81.56\%$, 1978年占总用水的$83.17\%$，图S3)。
As the dominant water demand during the massive supply regime (P1), the area of irrigated agriculture in the YRB expanded rapidly at a rate of $0.25*10^6 ha/yr$ (Figure\ref{fig:Causes} A), simultaneously supported by increasing supply through the construction of reservoirs (\textit{Appendix} Figure~\ref{fig:reservoirs}).
% 然而，进入P2后，灌溉区扩张停滞，工业和服务业逐渐增长，用水需求增加(图re\ref{fig: Causes} B)，导致灌溉用水量比例下降$8\%$ S3。
Entering the transformation governance regime (P2), however, the expansion of irrigated areas slowed down, and industry and services gradually took off (Figure\ref{fig:Causes} A and B).
% 水分利用效率由P2变化到P3。
Then, the efficiency of water use changed obviously from P2 to P3.
Not only irrigated areas keep their slow expansion in the adaptation oriented regime (P3) (Figure\ref{fig:Causes}A), but industry and urban services also assumed a more vital economic role (represented by Gross Added Values, GVA) (Figure~\ref{fig:Causes}B).
Because of increased efficiency, however, they both experienced significant declines in water use for a unit irrigated area or unit production (Figure~\ref{fig:Causes}A and Figure~\ref{fig:Causes}B).
As a result, the differences between sectors and regions in water use reduced while the total water stress steadily remained high during the adaptation oriented regime (Figure~\ref{fig:IWGI}A).

% 最后，环境背景、社会转型和水治理政策在这三个时期都发挥了作用。
Environmental context, social transformation and policies played roles in all three regimes.
We calculated the ratios of regional and basinal water use for each reservoir (R/B ratio) (Figure~\ref{fig:Causes}C), with a higher ratio representing a potential role in water supply rather than basinal regulations.
Under the guiding ethos of ``conquering nature'', most of the reservoirs were built in regions with high water demands during the massive supply regime (R/B ratios were significantly higher, $p<0.01$, see Figure~\ref{fig:Causes}C)).
Since the transformation governance regime (P2), the number of new reservoirs decreased significantly and significantly increased basinal policies rigorously controlled the allocation of water (Figure~\ref{fig:Causes}D, $p<0.01$ and \textit{SI Appendix} Figure~\ref{fig:reservoirs}).
In the adaptation oriented regime, authorities proposed more national-level water governance policies under the guidance of the national strategy ``environmental regulation'' (Figure~\ref{fig:Causes}D).
The regime shift from P1 to P2 is in line with the increasing water supply and demands; while driven by regulatory policies and efficiency enhancement under stable water stress from P2 to P3.
