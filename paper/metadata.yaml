title: Identifying regime transitions for water governance at a basin scale

abstract: In many large river basins, water governance regimes from natural to social-ecological or `hydrosocial' situations profoundly change who gets water, when, and how. Therefore, identifying regime changes is critical to understanding the transition and guiding sustainability in water governance. We combined three main dimensions -stress, purpose and allocation- to develop a quantitative Integrated Water Governance Index (IWGI) to detect water governance regimes at a basin scale. Applying the IWGI to a rapidly-changing basin (the Yellow River Basin, China) describes how water governance shifts between massive supply, transformation governance, and adaptation-oriented regimes. In the YRB, the regime shifts' underlying causes were increasing water supply and demand before the governance transformation and re-allocation and regulation after the transformation. The IWGI offers a comprehensive and straightforward approach to linking the water governance regimes to the following challenges in sustainability, along with the hydrosocial transition.
