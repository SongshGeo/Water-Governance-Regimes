title: Identifying regime transitions for water governance at a basin scale

abstract: In many large river basins, the use and governance of rivers for socio-economic development has led to a global transformation from natural to social-ecological or ‘hydrosocial’ water regimes. Water governance decides who gets water, when, and how much. Identifying how and when water governance regimes change is therefore critical to understanding social-ecological water dynamics and guiding the efficient and sustainable use of water. We combined three main dimensions of water governance (supply, purpose and allocation) to develop a quantitative Integrated Water Governance Index (IWGI) that can detect regime shifts in water governance at a basin scale. Applying the index to a rapidly-changing large river basin (the Yellow River Basin, China) shows that it can describe shifts between three water governance regimes (respectively, massive supply regime; purpose-focused regime; and many-sided governance regime) over half a century, and offer a way to relate these shifts to environmental, economic social and political changes. Our application of the IWGI suggests a widespread transition schema for water governance regimes and a general transformative trajectory as a hypothesis for understanding hydrosocial water cycles in the Anthropocene. The different governance challenges that occurred at different phases of the transition of the Yellow River also suggest potentially useful guidelines for the coordinated governance of big river basins in general.
